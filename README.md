### What I learned

With this challenge, I was able to put into practice knowledge about the use of routes with react-router-dom, passing properties through the url, making custom requests to the API. In addition to developing logic for loading and also implementing a dark mode. I was also able to fix new knowledge, creating pre-defined filters as well as through a search input for the user to use, typing letter by letter.
